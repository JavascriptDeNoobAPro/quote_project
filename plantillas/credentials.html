        Cutting Edge Events offers a fresh approach to the world of [Meetings & Events]. As the name of the company suggests, we are on top of the latest technologies, and apply them every day to stay on top of the game.
          We at Cutting Edge Events are very proud of our progress, from a two man operation back in 2008, to the award winning agency that we are today.
          Here’s a brief list of our main Unique Selling Points and typical workflow, which combines with a honest passion for the industry.

                  <li>
                      When you send us a RFP, rather than a 26-page pdf and an excel sheet budget, you get a private website link containing all the information you need, in a beautiful structured layout including maps, and program overviews.
                  </li> 
                  <li>
                      As a special service, we offer to build the very same website using your logo, so that you can directly send the link to your client. If you send us the text in your language, we can place it in the website - t&c apply
                  </li> 
                  <li>
                      If the program is confirmed, we will assign your project to an experienced project manager that will be your main point of contact. All the documents, contracts, financials, and communications leading up to the Event will be added to the original website , so that you - the client - get easy access to the information at all times.
                  </li> 
                  <li>
                      We will share working documents in the cloud, like the day-by-day and transfer lists, so that rather than exchanging thousands of emails, you will be able to edit just one document. It just works!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      All our hard and honest work during the past 10 years is paying off, and we currently enjoy a vast network of vendors within the industry across all our destinations - namely Spain and Portugal Thanks to this network, we are able to offer a wide range of MICE products and mind-blowing activities.
                  </li> 
                  <li>
                      All in all, we encourage you to try us - and experience an Agency that works like no other in the industry !
